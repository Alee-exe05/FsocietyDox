# **App Name**: FSociety Dox

## Core Features:

- Module Upload: Allow users to upload modules in TXT format.
- Module Display: Display uploaded modules with metadata: filename, upload date, uploader's name/role (CEO, Admin, VIP, Normal).
- Role-based styling: Color-code uploader names based on roles: CEO (red), Admin (purple, glittering effect), VIP (yellow, glittering effect), Normal (white).
- Dashboard: Show statistics of created items and percentage ratios with other values in an administrative dashboard
- Realtime User List: Display list of online users, updated live.
- Multilingual Support: Enable translation into Italian, English, and French languages. The app includes logic to show an appropriate welcome message (and other messaging as needed). The language selection is 'remembered' by the browser.
- Text moderation tool: An LLM-powered tool identifies sensitive PII within user-generated modules, like social security numbers, home addresses, or criminal records, according to region-specific regulations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2e2ed2) to align with the 'FSociety' theme and provide a base for the monochromatic scheme.
- Background color: Black (#000000) to set a dark, hacking-style tone.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) to ensure elements are visible and user role differentiations like CEO in red (#FF0000), admin in violet (#800080) with glittering effects, and VIP in yellow (#FFFF00) with glittering effects.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer sections of text.
- Minimalist icons in shades of gray and blue to maintain a clean, hacker-inspired aesthetic.
- Responsive layout adapted for desktop, Android, and iOS devices.
- Subtle animations and transitions for a smoother user experience; for example, loading spinners on charts.
